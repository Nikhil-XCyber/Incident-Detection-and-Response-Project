# Incident-Detection-and-Response-Project
Hands-on cybersecurity project utilizing Splunk for SIEM and UFW for defense. I configured Splunk to ingest SSH logs and performed Log Analysis to identify events consistent with a brute-force attack. This detection instantly triggered an automated response that leveraged the victim machine's firewall, UFW, to block the attacker's IP.
